# Customer-segmentation

we worked on a data provided by a local clothing franchise. Our tasks included data preprocessing, feature engineering, label encoding, and outlier detection. We performed data visualization, inferential and descriptive statistics, and scaling. We also applied principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction to 3D data. Using the elbow method, we implemented K-means and agglomerative clustering, and evaluated the clusters using the silhouette score.As part of an intern team at Net Soft Solutions, we worked on a data provided by a local clothing franchise.
